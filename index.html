Don't use plastics .Use of plastics is very harmful to our 
earth's enviroinment.It take nearly 2 million years to
decay . when it is dumped in ground it blocks rain water
to drain. when the plastics burn a toxic substance called 
carbonmonoxide is released which pollutes our enviroinment 
very badly.so the human should be aware of using plastics
in shops the plastics should be strictly prohibited  
                 
                  DONT  USE  PLASTICS
                     SAVE   EARTH!!
